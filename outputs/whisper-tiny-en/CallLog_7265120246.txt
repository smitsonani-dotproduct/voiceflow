One moment please. All right. I've got your account for that. How may I help you today? Okay. So since I've since the purchase of this home, I've had to essentially reconstruct it from top to bottom because the previous seller that sold it to me sold it fraudulently. And there are some concealed defects that he did not disclose upon the sale. So long story short, I have exhausted all my options currently. And as you can see, I'm very past due on my current mortgage because I've had to expend your chair almost all of my savings in credit to almost fix this home. So I am in a bit of a bind here where I'm going to need to step in and have my financial institution at least be made aware or help me at least sell the home so I can avoid a foreclosure because that's most likely the direction I'm heading towards now. Oh, okay. I know that's a lot of it. Yeah. Okay. Well, what I can do is we do have a mortgage assistance team that can go over some options if you're interested in exploring different options to avoid foreclosure and help you get back on track. Would you like to speak with them today? Sure. Okay. And do you currently reside at this property address? No, this is a rental property. Okay. All right. Do you have any other questions? Please replace two on a hold and connect you with a specialist. That's it. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. One moment, please. Hello, Mr. Falo. Thank you so much for holding. I appreciate your patience. I have got Joshua on the line here, a specialist who will go ahead and take over and assist you further from here. You both take care. Have a wonderful rest of your day. Thank you.
