Good afternoon. Thank you so much for calling Valor Mortgage. My name is Grace and my Asian ID is 1375. I record a line. May I have your full name? Liza Feldman. Do you have a different last name on file? Dubrow. Thank you. And thank you for getting authenticated through the automated system. Do you see that you're like to make a payment towards your escrow account? Is that correct? No. So basically what happened was when I was getting my insurance home insurance renewed for this year, it came up with agent that unfortunately it was not told to my insurance company that our roof had been taking care of the year before because we switched insurance companies. So they didn't realize we had a new roof. So basically they gave us a refund on our policy because they had charged us based on an old roof. Does that make sense? Okay. So you have a check. I mean, did you already? Are you? Yeah. So I have a check, but what I'm trying to figure out is, is that mine to keep or is that something that I need to deposit into my escrow account? If it's related to insurance, then I believe that's something you can keep. But if it's related, I mean, I'm sorry, let me rephrase that. If it's tied to your escrow obligations, so property insurance, property taxes, then you would want to replenish your escrow account. But if it's part of an insurance claim, then yeah, you can do it, do with it as you intended. No, I'm just saying like, basically I was talking to the end to my insurance broker about it and she was just basically saying that, you know, a property analysis has not been done on our home yet. I think it's done in March and I'm not sure if it looks as though that our escrow account is going to be, you know, I guess higher, lower, whatever it is. And so by putting more money in our escrow account, it might help balance our monthly mortgage, or if that's not necessary right now. Well, it would help, but you're not due for analysis until March unless you request an earlier one. And only if you had changes that would impact you over $500 or more, like, for instance, within your tax status change or if your insurance premium has changed. You could put it back in time for your March analysis if they determine based on your funds at that time and the account changes. If you have a $50 or more surplus that isn't required to pay your escrow, you would get a refund back from escrow. But if you're short, that know, they adjust your payment. Yeah, of course. And I guess then my other question would be what does my escrow account look like now in terms of my, because we did just get more, I mean, sorry, get a different insurance policy. So I just want to make sure I mean, it's because we had advanced to like twenty four hundred for your insurance that we paid to travelers. It was like ninety three hundred. So you're right that that's the negative one thousand four hundred forty three dollars and thirty six. Okay. But that plan went so basically that plan went through. But it has since been altered actual our actual annual insurance is around fifty nine hundred that was what travelers tried to charge us but we altered it because obviously that's absurd to be spending that much on home insurance so because our policy has since changed what what happens there? You can request a new analysis, but if we sent in 9,300 and advance to 2,400, you do need to pay that back, but travelers should be giving you a prorated refund if it's going to be less than that. If we sent to 9300, but it's only 5800, then that refund is either going to be mailed back to you or refunded to your escrow account. We just don't have that yet. So it should be refunded to the escrow account, I assume. Okay. We'll then clarify that. What'd you say? You might want to give them a call so you can verify where to look out for where to look for it travelers are saying okay all right well thank you so much I appreciate it you're welcome and do you need me to transfer
