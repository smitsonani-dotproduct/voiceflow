We will need you to reach out to insurance.  Just to let them know of the change or the balance.  It's really important when it comes time for the renewal that they know where to send the invoice.  We can make sure we get that paid in a timely manner for you.  There were no ones not until September.  So it's nothing that you have an urgent deadline for.
