Good afternoon.  Thank you so much upon dollar mortgage.  My name is Grace.  My agent ID is 137.5.  I'm a recorded line.  May you have your full name?  Liza Feldman.  Oh, do you have a different last name?  On file?  Do we're out?  Do we're out?  Thank you.  And thank you for getting authenticated through the automated system.  I do see that you're like to make a payment towards your  Astro account.  Is that correct?  No.  So these only what happened was when I was getting my insurance  home insurance renewed for this year, it came up with the agent that  unfortunately, it was not.  told my insurance company that our roof had been taking care of  the year before because we switched insurance companies.  So they didn't realize we had a new roof.  So basically they gave us a refund on our policy because they had  charged us based on an old roof.  Does that make sense?  Okay.  So you have a check?  I mean, did you really?  Are you?  Yeah.  That's your account?  So I have a check.  But what I'm trying to figure out is, is that mine to keep or is that  something that I need to deposit into my escrow account?  If it's related to insurance, then I believe that's something you  can keep.  But if it's related, I mean, I'm sorry.  Let me rephrase that.  If it's tied to your escrow obligations, so property  insurance, property taxes, then you would want to replenish your  escrow account.  But if it's part of an insurance claim, then yeah, you can do  it, do it as you intended.  No, I'm just saying like basically I was talking to the  inch to my insurance broker about it.  And she was just basically saying that, you know, a property  analysis has not been done on our home yet.  I think it's done in March.  And I'm not sure if it looks as though that our escrow  account is going to be, you know, I guess higher, what a lower  whatever it is.  And so by putting more money in our escrow account, it might  help balance our monthly mortgage.  Or if that's not necessary right now.  Well, it would help.  But you're not due for analysis until March unless you request an  email.  And it's not really a one.  And only if you had changes that would impact you over $500  or more.  Like for instance, within your tax size change or if you're  an insurance premium hedge change, you could put it back in time  for your market analysis.  If they determine based on your funds at that time and the  account changes, if you have a $50 or more surplus that isn't  required to pay your escrow, you would get a refund back from  your escrow.  But if you're short, that's when, you know, they adjust their  payment.  Yeah, of course.  And I guess that in my other question would be, what does my escrow  account look like now in terms of my, because we did just get  more, I mean, sorry, get a different insurance policy.  So just want to make sure.  I mean, it's a bad challenge.  Because we had it, we had to like 24 hundred for your insurance  that we paid to travelers.  It was like 9300.  So you're in the negative.  But that's the negative $443 and $38.  Okay.  But that plan went.  So basically that plan went through.  But it has since been altered.  Actual, actual, actual annual insurance is around $5900.  That was what travelers tried to charge us.  But we altered it because obviously that's absurd to be spending  that much on home insurance.  So because our policy has since changed, what does that,  like what happens there?  You can request a new analysis.  But if we sent in 9300 and advanced to 2400, you do need to pay that  back.  Traveler should be giving you appropriate refund.  If it's going to be less than that.  If we sent in 9300, but it's only 5800, then that refund is  either going to be mailed back to you.  Or refund it to your escrow account.  We just don't have that yet.  So it should be refunded to the escrow account, I assume.  Okay.  I want to then comment by that.  What do you say?  You might want to give them a call so you can verify where to  to look out where to look for it.  Travelers are saying?  Okay.  All right.  Well, thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  You're welcome.  And you need me to check.
