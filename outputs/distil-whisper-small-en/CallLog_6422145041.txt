I'm just gonna look at your escrow statement. It looks like it was sent to you just recently. This escrow statement shows that you have a surplus, meaning there was extra money in your escrow account. So anything over $50, we send to you. And that's what looks like it happened. We sent you the 373, 33, because of how much is over in the account. Okay. That's the reason. Okay. It didn't attach. You didn't come with the account I don't, but if you had explained it, you know, on the attachment, then I wouldn't be calling. Yeah, I think, I just resent you the email. You should receive it now.
