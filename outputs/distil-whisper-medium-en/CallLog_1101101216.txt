Thank you for calling all the mortgage. This is James, age and ID number 1030 on a recording line. Who do I have the pleasure speaking with day? Yes, hi, my name is Juana, Cuyansac Castro. Thank you for that. I do see that you're fully authenticated through the IDR system. How can I help you out today? Yes, I'm calling just to ask about the PMI removal. I don't know if we qualify yet or I don't know what I need to do. Yeah, I can definitely take a look. Okay, I just wanted to confirm some quick contact information. The 941, yeah, 941, sorry, 941, Chocolate Street in Ozon Park, New York, is that still the correct mailing address? Yes, yes it is. All right, and then the email address I have your first and last name, 29 at gmail.com, is that correct? Correct, yeah. Alright, perfect. So let me take a look here because oftentimes it does have an automatic termination date, but let me see if there is anything that we would need in order to get to remove off the account. Bear with me one moment. Yeah, sure. Okay, so it looks like, okay, so it looks like the automatic termination date is October 1st, 2035, but if you're wanting to see, okay, so it looks like the automatic termination date is October 1st, 2035, but if you're wanting to see if it could remove before then, then I do have an email address that you would be able to submit the request directly to our mortgage insurance team and then they'll be able to let you know if you qualify to have it removed here sooner. What is the conditions like when I have to like because the letter that you guys send me it says that we've been paying the mortgage for a year and without missing any payments. Was that like the one condition? Is there any other? Yeah, so one of the conditions is we want to make sure that you have a clean payment history. And then we also take a look at your loan to value ratio. We're looking for it to be at 80% or below and that'll definitely help get it removed off of the account as well. Okay I can mean, you know, doesn't hurt. Yeah, and it's it. Absolutely. And if there's anything else that they need or that would help, they'll definitely be able to explain that in detail for you to help get it removed off of the account. Okay, great. Okay, so the email address that you'll send the email directly to our insurance team is going to be mortgage. And then the minus sign. Okay, insuranceon.com okay and then I'll repeat it I just to make sure you have to correct it's mortgage the minus sign insurance at valon.com. And then you would just essentially include your loan number in the subject line of the email and then you would just essentially include your loan number in the subject line of the email, and then you would be able to ask, hey, I'm looking to get more information about removing my private mortgage insurance. Can you please assess? And then we'll get back in touch with you. I would say within three to five business days, maybe sooner, just depending on our caseload. And then we'll kind of give you a little bit more information about that. Okay. All right, thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome. Did you have any other concerns or questions? I actually have another, I don't remember the name of the bank, Federal or something. The guy that helped me told me that I can refinance after certain time, you know, are we like, can we qualify for that yet? Or not yet, since the interest rate is higher than than. Yeah so for that part I'm not 100% sure so what I would have to do if you wanted to is I can transfer you directly to our lending department and then they would be able to give you more information about interest rates or to see if you qualify for a refinance. I'm gonna call back later. Let me take one thing at the time. I'm going to. Okay. Yeah, I'll call back. Thank you so much for your help. Oh, you're welcome. There is a survey at the end of the call. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, okay? You too. Bye.
