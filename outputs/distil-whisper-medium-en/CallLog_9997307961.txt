So we will be making a new escrow analysis not until February of next year. What I am seeing on your escrow account that it is positive at this time. So you do have an available balance of $1,143.54. Okay, we should have an insurance, the property tax is just paid out recently, right? Yes. Uh-huh. So we should have an insurance payment of 11909? 11th, correct, but we'll have two escrow payments by that time. Okay, and the escrow payment is going to be escrow taxes and insurance 17124. You got it. Okay, so my escrow balance right now I forgot to write that down. Oh, I'm sorry. Let me say to you again. Let's say I went into your it's 1143.54.54. Yes, sir. Okay.

So we'll have 13, 1554 roughly by the end of December. Yes, sir. And then, uh, the amount that's going out is $1.09, I believe, right? Yes, exactly. 1109, yes. All right. So we'll have a cushion in that account. Okay, good. All right. Let's see double check, boom, boom, we're okay. January will be the new insurance company.
