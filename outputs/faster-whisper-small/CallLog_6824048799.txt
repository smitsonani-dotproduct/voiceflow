thing for calling valid mortgage my name is Jacob agent ID is one three two  zero who do I the pleasure of speaking with today hi Jacob this is Adria  Magnus hello how are we doing today okay I'm calling up a couple things I'm a  little confused about I'm sure you can help me gotcha gotcha yeah let me know  no no they actually populated when he called in so I do appreciate that and  it did show that you came in fully authenticated so I'll be all good to go  thank you though all right and I'm known to the count what kind of questions do  we have for today there are really two of them one is there is a late charge of  51 46 apparently my I've never paid anything late before apparently my  monthly amount changed and I had this on auto pay mm-hmm and so I just assumed  that the correct amount was going to be taken out and when I was notified that it  hadn't been I paid the difference mm-hmm but you you still charged me a late fee  which I would like you to eliminate will do I can just do that right now  you're the best and perfect I was able to leave that leafy off the account so  there's no us sending fee balance anymore great now my next question is I  got a updated s escrow analysis and payment updates and you know I'm gonna  try to just auto pay again and I don't want to get myself in trouble and I  honestly can't tell what I am paying for December January and February gotcha yeah  this one this escrow analysis I can tell it's a little confusing so I can  definitely break this down for you okay so let me see escrow analysis  performed perfect okay so right now your payment amount is reflecting as a  thousand six hundred eighty nine dollars and ninety cents the reason why it's  reflecting that is because that will be the payment for January the reason why the  January payment is less than the other ones is because we did determine there  was a surplus of thirty eight dollars and sixty three cents which we do have  to refund back to you let me see that's been issued out yeah not yet  let me take a look into it real quick so yeah aren't you just going to take it  off whatever my monthly payment is after that I mean yeah that is accurate so  yes so the January payments since there's a surplus of the 3863 we're  actually just removing that from the January's payment and then starting in  February the 1728 53 that will be your new payment from February 2026 to  February 2027 okay okay I was confused because it says that your new monthly  mortgage payment starting January 1st and I saw two numbers and I wanted to make  sure I had it correct so okay all right yeah yeah some sort of confirming email  that you've eliminated that $51 fee let me see if I can type something up for  you right now I mean I know I just got one from you saying I owed it to you so  somewhere in there if you just send a confirmation that would be great yeah of  course let me see  yes I can definitely type something up for you let me get that going for you  all right perfect yeah I have that confirmation email just saying I was able  to leave the late fee and then I'll send that to the email that we have on file  which is a a m a g mom at iCloud comm is that correct that is correct yes perfect  so I have that sent out to you right now you can expect it within about a minute  after this call yes I'm not in any rush I just appreciate you doing this and  you've been a great help of course and before I let you go were there any  questions that I might have overlooked for today I don't think so oh I just got  your email perfect yes all right and then before I do let you go I do see  that you've been building equity inside your home just wait till now if you want  to explore the option to access the cash but things like home improvements no I  do not no worries I'll let you go see have a wonderful day there might be a  brief survey at the ending of the call that's fine that's fine all right thank  you so much of course bye-bye yes it should populate after this call if you  don't get a survey that'll be okay I know sometimes system is low like 5050  with them so if you get one I really do appreciate it if you fill it out if not  that'll be okay you enjoy your day okay thank you you too thank you
