I am extremely dissatisfied with my recent order.  I am John Davis and I'm calling about order number 123456.  The FR-40401 refrigerator arrived yesterday  and it's damaged.  There's a huge dent on the side  and it's not cooling properly.  I wanna know what you're going to do about this.  I demand the replacement  and I want it delivered as soon as possible.  I've been without a working refrigerator  for two days now.
