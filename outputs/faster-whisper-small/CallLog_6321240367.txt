calling Valin Mortgage. My name is Jan. My agent ID is 1055. May I have your first and last name,  please? Sure. My name is Julie Simmons. Thank you very much. Give me just a moment.  Thank you for verifying yourself on the account as you called in. And just a reminder, this call  may be monitored or recorded for training and quality purposes. And how may I help you today?  Well, I've been trying for a month to get my escrow closed because my mortgage went up $800.  So I had a link sent, but I couldn't open the link so I don't know what it said.  So I'm hoping you can check into that and send the link. Yes, just give me a moment here and let me  just look at some things and I'll see if I can't send that document over to you. I'm going to  place you on a brief hold and I'll be right back. That'd be great. Thank you. Sure. Back and go  right to bed. And thank you for holding and I'll be right back with you. Okay. Okay. All right.  She knows it's good. Okay. I have gone ahead and sent the docu-sign to yourself and to  Patricia. Patricia. Yeah. Yes, as well. So you should be receiving those. Fill them out. Make  sure that you check post boxes that you want taxes and insurance removed and we can take  care of that for you. Give us, once you receive them and send them back, give us five to seven  business days to process that and then you'll be getting more information about it.  Wonderful. Thanks for your help. We'll look for that now. You're more than welcome. Yeah,  give it about an hour. You should have it within that time and it went right to your  emails that you have on file. So it should be no problem with that. Is there anything  else I can assist you with today? Nope. That's it. Okay. Well, you have a great day. There may be  a brief survey coming your way. Have a safe and happy holiday. Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.  Thank you. Bye.
