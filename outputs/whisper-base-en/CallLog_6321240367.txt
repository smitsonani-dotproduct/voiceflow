So I'm hoping you can check into that. All right. Let me send the link. Yes, just give me a moment here and let me just look at some things and I'll see if I can't send that document over to you. I'm going to place you on a brief hold and I'll be right back. That'd be great. Thank you. Sure. I can go right to bed. Thank you for holding it. I'll be right back with you. Okay. Okay. All right. She knows it's good. Okay. I have gone ahead and sent the DocuSign to yourself and to Patricia. Patricia. Yes. As well. So you should be receiving those. Fill them out.
