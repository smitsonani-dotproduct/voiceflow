Hi, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. Good to hear. Let me open up your account. I just see that you came in verified to the IVR system. Thank you for that. This calls monitor recorded for treating and quality purposes. One second. And I also see that your loan is assigned to an agent in order to provide you with the most accurate information. I need to transfer you over before I do so. We go ahead and open this up and I do see here that we receive that incomplete mortgage assistance application for the 65 these paths do. Yes. Okay. And can I have the reason for your delay and continue before we get started? Well, it was because of the medical expenses and bills. But yeah, I was calling because I, when the forbearance ends, I just want to see what I could do other than extending it. Do you want to extend it correct? Well, I just say before said that we could do like a lower payment. Okay. Okay. So where do you extend at right now where you're delinquent with your hardship? Uh, we've got a lot of spotted cleared up. Awesome. Are you working now? Yeah. Awesome. And you live in your home, correct? Yes. Let me go ahead and see. Your forbearance is coming to an end and complete missing items. Unable to verify your income, please provide current pay stub. Hold on, this change for Chris Brown. That's what's missing. Okay. Well, if I'm willing to select the forbearance and insert my payments again, then I wouldn't have to complete that. All right. Oh, those are good questions. I'm not sure. I'm not in that department. I'm going to have to transfer you over. Let me see if I have an agent available. Bear with me. Okay, let me see if I have an agent available. Bear with me.
