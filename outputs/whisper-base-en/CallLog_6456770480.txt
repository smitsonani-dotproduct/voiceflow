And then I was able to pull up the account. But before I'm able to access it, it does look like you've built equity in your home. Would you be interested in speaking with somebody about that today? No, not today. No problem. And then I do understand that you have questions on your escrow balance. How may I assist today? Yeah, so I just want to get this up to date so that it came back to where it was. Basically what happened, there were two policies. So they made it out twice. One story short, I got that refund check for one of the policies. So there's only one active policy on file. So I just need to apply that refund check back to the escrow accounts and see if there's anything else additional that's needed on top of that to bring the payment back to where it should be instead of going up next month. Got it. No problem. What is the amount that you received or that you're putting back into the account? Well, let me confirm the amount to be exact. It's for $4,895.38. But I did at the escrow statement a lot. I'm not mistaken. It's showing a shortage of $5,244.64. That's correct. That's what needs to be reapplied back. Then you guys would reanalyze the escrow. Is that how it works? Yes, so are you looking to make just the 489538 or are you looking to make the shortage amount? No, well, I want to do the shortage that way. It doesn't increase the payment. Okay, so you're looking to do the 524464? Yes, And I was wondering, am I able to schedule that payment to be drafted next week? You can. Yeah. Um, once the payment is cleared, then that'll be adjusted. Um, it does take about 35 business days for that to be adjusted. Is that okay with you? That's fine. Yeah. Cause I think they'll give us enough time. I just, because I deposit a check, I just want to make sure it's officially available before drafting. So if we can schedule it maybe for the 8th of December to get drafted. Okay, and then I do want to let you know that when you pay the shortage amount, your payment does decrease by approximately four hundred thirty seven dollars and five cents So your payment will approximately Let's see one second it'll go from 29 1901 to approximately 24 81 96 Okay, yeah, I think that's where it was Yeah, it was was at 235450. So it'll still increase slightly, but it won't like go back to that specific amount. I'm so sorry you're cutting out. What was that? You're like really like cutting out a choppy. Can you hear me okay? Hello. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, so it sounds like you're speaking. You're just like breaking up really bad. I can't make out what you're saying. I'm sorry. Hello. You do sound the same. Sorry.
