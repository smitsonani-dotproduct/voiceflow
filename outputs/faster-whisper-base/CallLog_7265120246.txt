So long story short, I have exhausted all my options currently and as you can see, I'm very past due on my current mortgage because I've had to expand your chair almost all of my savings in credit to almost fix this home.  So I am in a bit of a bind here where I'm going to need to step in and have my financial institution at least be made aware or help me at least sell the home so I can avoid a foreclosure because that's most likely the direction I'm heading towards now.
