Hi, my name is Jean Pierre, and I receive a check for 373 hours and 33 cents from you guys from  valent mortgage, and we do an explanation. I don't know because my mortgage was recently sold to  you guys from wholesale mortgage, so I don't know what the 373 dollars was for.  Is this like a late fee? No, that's not receiving a check.  Oh, a check. Give me a second. I have to give it to your accountant. Do you happen to have your  loan number? Uh, no. Okay, do you have your address, property address? Yes.

Just recently this escrow statement shows that you have a surplus, meaning there was extra money  in your escrow account. So anything over $50 we sent to you. And that's what looks like it happened.  And we sent you the 373-33 because that was how much is over in the account.  Okay. That's the reason. Okay. It didn't attach. It didn't come with your account.

But it's an email that I sent you that does have the escrow statement in it. That does give  an explanation on that. Okay. Okay. Thank you. No problem at all. Is there anything else I'm  able to help you with? No. That's all. All right. There's a brief survey for me at the end of this  call. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day and happy holidays. Okay. Thanks.
