I was calling to see if it was possible to do, um, one deferment on a mortgage payment, if that ever hap- if we can... Is that, that's an option? Uh, and what's the reason? Because you need to have a reason. Yes. Our transmission in our car ha- um, was very expensive to replace, and so that's why. Oh, okay. Just one moment. And I, I also see that you have built equity in your home, and there's also the option to connect you with a [clears throat] loan officer. [clears throat] Like, if you would like to make an additional loan, they can assist you on that. Yeah, no, I just-- Well, just a little help would be a blessing. I don't, you know, I don't want to do any loans or anything like that. Just if we could get a, um, just miss... If we could just, um- Defer? - either forbearance or, um, yeah, postpone, that would be wonderful. Just- Okay. - if we can add it to the loan or something like that, that would be really helpful. I don't, I don't wanna get-- We don't wanna get a loan or anything. We, we're, we're trying to get, pay off the house. Oh, okay. Eventually. [laughing] I understand. Yes. [laughing] Okay, so let me try to find- Also, my husband, um- -a mortgage assistance. Hmm? I was just gonna say, um, along with the transmission situation, um, my husband's in landscape, and so the weather really affects us, um, and there's been quite a lot of weather. Um, you know, he gets busy after it dries up, but there's only so many hours that you can work, right? [laughing] So, um, yeah, so his work has been affected by weather as well. Oh, okay. I understand. Okay. Just one moment. But mostly the transmission. Okay. So I'm going to contact you with the mortgage assistance. It's an- another department, uh, to see... They will evaluate if they can postpone the, the coming payment for the end of the, of the loan, probably. Yeah. Yes, that would be a blessing. Thank you. Okay, sure. Just...
