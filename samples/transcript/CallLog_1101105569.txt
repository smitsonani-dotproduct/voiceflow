Loading into the account here now. All righty, and I do see a new transfer as of December first. Welcome to Valon. All right, and, uh, how may I help you today? Uh, yeah, I was just trying to see if I can, like, get into my account yet. Um, I haven't received anything in the mail, I don't believe, and, um, I didn't know if, like, I already have a payment due, and it's gonna start to, like, double up on me. Um, the December payment is due. Yes, and, um, I can help you get online if you like. Have you, um, tried to get into the account today? Yeah, it's, um... I think I tried to do, like, the register my loan. I have a loan number from Omaha, Mutual of Omaha Mortgage, and I tried doing that and my Social Security, and it didn't work. Um- Okay, um- but I don't know if I've been given a new loan number. Yes, yes, you do have a new loan number with Valon, and you would need to enter that one into the, um, dashboard to get registered. I can give it to you when you're ready. Um, okay. Yeah. All right. It's one one zero- One one zero. One one zero. One one zero. Five five six nine. One one zero, one one zero, five five six nine? Yes. Okay. Okay, and go ahead and try to enter that with your Social. You should be able to get in. Yeah. All right, cool. I think that won't work. Okay. Yeah, I think I got it. Uh, cool. Great. All righty, so on your online dashboard, you can make payments there. You'll just need to enter your, um, bank account information. You'll find all your statements, um- Okay. Um- Do you have, uh, any questions about what you're seeing there on the dashboard? Uh, no, I don't think so. I, out of curiosity, is it possible to, da, da, da, da... Is it possible to change the payment date? It is not. I'm sorry. That's okay. You do have to... Yeah, it's gonna be the first, but you do have a grace period each month. Ends on the sixteenth, eight PM Eastern Time. Got it. Okay. Uh- And you do- Sounds good. Yep, I'm all logged in, and that works. Okay. All right. Okay. And, um, just wanna mention that we do have a welcome letter headed out to you, uh, in the next couple of days. Um, it'll also be loaded online, but there is important information in that packet. Please keep an eye out for it. Okay. You'll see on the cover page, section four, um, says, "How to update my insurance." Um, we will need you to reach out to your insurance just to let them know of the change over to Valon. Oh. It's really important when it comes time for the renewal, that they know where to send the invoice, so we can make sure we get that paid in a timely manner for you. Your renewal's not till September, so it's nothing, um, that you have an urgent deadline for. Okay. But they won't make the change if we call them because we're kind of an unknown third party. They don't know we have a new relationship yet, so they won't make a change to your policy from, you know- Got it ... an, an unknown third party. Yeah, I've, I've been through, I've been through that- Oh, okay. -before. It's annoying, but- Yeah. Yeah, just the only thing we ask of you, and then taxes, we'll take care of setting everything up ourselves. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks so much, Kenny. Welcome to Valon once again. Okay. There's a brief survey at the end of the call. Take care, have a good rest of your day. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye. Thanks.
