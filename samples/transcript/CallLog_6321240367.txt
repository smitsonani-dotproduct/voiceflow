For Colleen Fallon Mortgage, my name is Jan. My agent ID is 1055. May I have your first and last name, please? Sure. My name is Julie Simmons. Thank you very much. Give me just a moment. Thank you for verifying yourself on the account as you called in. And just a reminder, this call may be monitored or recorded for training and quality purposes. And how may I help you today? Well, I've been trying for a month to get my escrow closed because my mortgage went up $800. So, I had a link sent, but I couldn't open the link, so I don't know what it said. So, I'm hoping you can check into that. All right. Let me send the link. Yes, just give me a moment here, and let me just look at some things, and I'll see if I can't send that signed over to you. I'm going to place you on a brief hold, and I'll be right back. That would be great. Thank you. Sure. Back and go right to bed. And thank you for holding, and I'll be right back with you. Okay. Okay. We'll be here. All right. She knows it's good. Okay, I have gone ahead and sent the DocuSign to yourself and to Patricia. Patricia. Yes, as well. So, you should be receiving those. Fill them out. Make sure that you check both boxes that you want taxes and insurance removed, and we can take care of that for you. Once you receive them and send them back, give us five to seven business days to process that, and then you'll be getting more information about it. Wonderful. Thanks for your help. We'll look for that now. You're more than welcome. Yeah, give it about an hour. You should have it within that time, and it went right to your emails that you have on file, so it should be no problem with that. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Nope. That's it. Okay. Well, you have a great day. Thank you. There may be a brief survey coming your way. Have a safe and happy holiday. Thank you. You, too. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye.
