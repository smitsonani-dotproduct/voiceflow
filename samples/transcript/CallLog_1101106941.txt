Thank you for calling Valon Mortgage. My name is Jacob, agent ID one two three zero. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? I'm sorry, what was your name? Jacob? Yes. Hi, Jacob. My name is Albert Hsu, H-S-U. Okay. Do you have a loan number so I can pull up that account? No. I, I've been told that my, [chuckles] the mortgage got transferred to you. I know this is not your fault, but they never gave me a loan number, and so I'm trying to figure out how to make payments when I don't have a loan number. Incredibly irritating. Do you have the old loan number, so I can pull it up account, um, on my end with that? They just set up a loan, so I'm not sure what that number is. Is there any other way to look it up, or you can't do anything? What's the property address? Uh, now, hold on. Um, it's, uh, one six zero five Labrador Drive in Columbia, Missouri. Can you spell the name of the, uh, street? Labrador, like the dog. L-A-B-R-A-D-O-R Drive. Just one moment. Okay, here. And then I do just have to let you know that the call may be monitored and/or recorded for quality and- That'd be great. Now, please take a complaint that, um... that I was told that my, [chuckles] that my mortgage was sold to a new, new- to Valon, and then I never got a mortgage number. So that's the number one thing I need from you guys. Okay. And can you verify the last four digits of your social? Two three zero seven. And can you verify the date of birth? Um, ten twenty-six seventy-four. Okay. And I do just have to just make sure we have the most up-to-date contact information for you regarding the transfer. So phone number I have listed here is five one three five eight four one zero zero zero, is what I have on file. Nope. Nope. One second. I'm just go ahead and edit that. And what's the better contact number for you? Seven five seven three five four two three seven seven. All right. And then email address I do show is scuber, um, hsu@gmail.com. That's correct. Sorry about that. Just give me a second. I have another call in five minutes too, so I can't, I can't wait too. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just... I just have some questions I have to ask. And then mailing address- I understand. I just- Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, the mailing address I do show is three nine... Uh, sorry, seven nine three five Ashley View Drive, um, Cincinnati, Ohio, five... I'm sorry, four five two two seven. That is correct. Here, and yes, I do show that the loan did transfer on December first to us, and I do have that new loan number. That'd be great. Um, with us when you're ready? Yep. Yep. So that's going to be one one zero one one zero six nine four one. I'm gonna read that back to you. I've got one one zero one one zero six nine four one. That is correct. Okay, um, please, uh, confirm the, um, mailing address so that I can get them to send your check correctly. Mailing address for the, for the- Where to send the check to? Yeah. Yes, please. Yep. So it's going to be, um, Valon Mortgage, Inc. Yeah. And it's going to be PO box six six zero zero four three. Okay. They never gave me that. They gave me a Gemini Drive in Beaverton. Yeah, that is a general mailing address. So should I be sending it to that or the PO box you're gonna give me? The PO box that I'm mentioning. [chuckles] Okay, I have not that nowhere. Okay, what's the PO box? So Valon Mortgage, Inc, and then PO box six six zero zero four three, Dallas, Texas seven five two six six. All right. Well, this is extremely poor. Um, and I know it's not your fault. So you said PO box... Here. So you said PO box six six zero zero four three in Dallas, Texas, and you said seven five two six six. Is that right? That is correct. Okay. So that's nowhere in any of the materials that I received. Um, they gave me a business mailing address of nine four five zero Southwest Gemini Drive in Beaverton, Oregon, nine seven zero zero eight, but do not send it to there, right? Yeah, don't send it to there. That's just, uh, just sending, like, correspondence or anything like that. That's not a payment address. [laughing] But actually, they told me that that's the payment address in the message I got. Yeah, that's not the payment address. I am so incredibly irritated. That is really er- erroneous. Um, wow! Okay. Well, I will send a complaint letter, um, saying that, uh, to the people who sent me this email. Thank you for your time. You've been wonderful, but, um, again, this is, this is very, very poor business practice from the people who I get the notice of mortgage servicing, um, of. Thank you for your time. You're very welcome. You have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye.
