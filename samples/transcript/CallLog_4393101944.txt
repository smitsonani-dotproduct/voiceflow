In order to provide you with the most accurate information, I need to transfer you over before I do so. Let me go ahead and open this up. And I do see here that we received an incomplete mortgage assistance application for the 65 days past due. Yes. Okay. And can I have the reason for your delinquency before we get started? Well, it was because of the medical expenses and bills. But, yeah, I was calling because when the forbearance ends, I was just wanting to see what I could do other than extending it. You want to extend it, correct? Well, the agent I was with before said that we could do, like, a lower payment. Okay. So where do you stand at right now where you're delinquent with your hardship we've almost got it cleared up awesome are you working now? yeah awesome and you live in your home correct? yes let me go ahead and see. Your forbearance is coming to an end. Incomplete missing items. Unable to verify your income. Please provide current pay stub. Hold on. This changed for Chris Brown. That's what's missing. Okay. Well, if I'm willing to put the forbearance in and start my payments again, then I wouldn't have to complete that, right? That is a good question. I'm not sure. I'm not in that department.
