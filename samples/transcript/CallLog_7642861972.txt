 Thank you so much for calling Valorant Mortgage. My name is Grace and my agent ID is 1375 on the recorded line. May I have your full name? Liza Feldman. Oh, do you have a different last name on file? Dubrow. Dubrow. Thank you. And thank you for getting authenticated through the automated system. Do you see that you're like to make a payment towards your estro account is that correct no so basically what happened was when i was getting my insurance home insurance renewed for this year it came up with agent that unfortunately um it was not told to my insurance company that our roof had been taken care of the year before because we switched insurance companies. So they didn't realize we had a new roof. So basically they gave us a refund on our policy because they had charged us based on an old roof. Does that make sense? Okay. So you have a check? I mean, did you already already are you trying to replenish your account so i have a check but what i'm trying to figure out is is that mine to keep or is that something that i need to deposit into my escrow account um if it's related to insurance then i believe that's something you can keep but if it's related i mean i mean i'm sorry let me rephrase that if it's tied to your escrow obligations so property insurance property taxes then you would want to replenish your escrow account but if it's part of of an insurance claim, then, yeah, you can do with it as you intended. No, I'm just saying, like, basically I was talking to my insurance broker about it, and she was just basically saying that, you know, a property analysis has not been done on our home yet. I think it's done in March. And I'm not sure if it looks as though that our escrow account is going to be, you know, I guess higher, lower, whatever it is. And so by putting more money in our escrow account, it might help balance our monthly mortgage or if that's not necessary right now. Well, it would help, but you're not due for analysis until March unless you request an earlier one, and only if you had changes that would impact you over $500 or more. Like, for instance, within your tax status change or if your insurance premium tax change, you could put it back in time for your March analysis if they determine based on your funds at that time and the account changes. If you have a $50 or more surplus that isn't required to pay your escrow, you would get a refund back from escrow. But if you're short, that's when they adjust your adjust your payment yeah of course um and I guess then my other question would be um what does my escrow account look like now in terms of my because I we did just get more I mean sorry get a different um insurance policy so I just want to make sure i mean it's shown because we had to advance you like 2400 for your insurance that we paid to travelers it was like 9300 so you're the negative that's the negative 1443.38 okay but that plan went so basically that plan went through but it has since been altered actual our actual annual insurance is around 5,900 that was what travelers tried to charge us but we altered it because obviously that's absurd to be spending that much on home insurance so because our policy has since changed what what does that, like, what happens there? You can request a new analysis, but if we sent in $9,300 and advance you $2,400, you do need to pay that back, but Traveler should be giving you a prorated refund if it's going to be less than that. If we sent in $9,300 but it's only $5,800, then that refund is either going to be mailed back to you or refunded to your escrow account. We just don't have that yet. It should be refunded to the escrow account, I assume. Okay. You might want to give them a call to verify that. What did you say? You might want to give them a call so you can verify where to look out for where to look for it travelers are saying okay all right well thank you so much I appreciate it you're welcome and do you need me to transfer
