The bank will not even release the money necessarily to Atomic, because that's a different organization. Thank you. Hello? Benjamin, can you hear me? Hello? Benjamin! Yes, hi, Jürgen, hello, I called not so long ago. Yeah, sorry, we take your phone and then it just connects. Sorry about that. Oh, really? Yeah, it has right now. I got there too late just now. Okay. Well, at least we got each other right here right now. Listen, Jürgen, as I was told by my finance team, they looked into this. Now, I personally deal with Atomic, but to be honest, I never cashed out. I stockpiled my crypto on Atomic. I never moved anything out of Atomic, right? Let’s put it this way. So my personal knowledge may be limited. But upon checking everything with my finance team, they’re telling me that the taxes are included in this money. So the taxes are included in this particular amount of cash that they’re asking of you. Now, how are they planning to refund it? I have no idea, right? That’s something I must not explain. But the money that is supposed to be coming into your account, and most likely the next step will be to ask you for the payment details, I suppose, like where the money is going to be sent. The money will be coming in from an account that is not related to crypto. That is the reason how they justify it. You understand? That’s how you don’t pay taxes after the money comes into your account, because the transfer has nothing to do with cryptocurrency, the cash out itself, if you understand what I mean. Yeah. So what I don’t understand, Benjamin, is what we are told. First of all, my next question is, can we transfer it back to MDAX as we planned, like you said, and then convert it? Well, this is something that has to be done with Atomic support. I suppose it is possible. I see no reason why it wouldn’t be possible. But if you can shoot them a message and tell them I’m not interested in having it transferred to Canadian dollars, I’m going to transfer it over to MDAX by myself, whether that’s possible. Like we already need it. So that kind of message. Yeah, sure, why not? Because in terms of taxes, when we get it back to MDAX and do it on our account, we put it in a special account, and for whatever we have invested, we don’t have to pay taxes. Wait, wait, wait, just to correct you there. Any money coming into Canadian dollars from MDAX is taxable. There is no debate about it. The question is from what type of account or from what business the money is coming. MDAX being one of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, that money will be taxable at some point. You understand? Oh yeah, yes it will be. One hundred percent. There is no debate about it. Whether it’s even one hundred dollars, it’s taxable. You understand? There is no debate about it. And given that you’re withdrawing more than what you’ve invested, you will have taxes. There is no question about it. Now, what Atomic is offering is not clearly explained. So let’s put it this way, I have to give you a disclaimer. It’s speculation, a very educated speculation. It can be clarified in future messages. What I’m guessing is that there’s going to be a Canada transfer from their account to your account. That account will not have any relation to cryptocurrency whatsoever. Ergo, the transfer they’re doing to you will not be taxable. Now, how they’re going to justify giving you these fees back, I have no idea. This is not within my means to understand. In the screenshot you sent me, they mentioned that it is refundable. Yes. And if it’s taxes, there must be a Canadian company in there, right? No, Atomic was founded in Tallinn, Estonia. It’s a Baltic country and Atomic complies with EU financial regulations. I don’t know how that applies to their Canadian branch. I really don’t know. But I’ve had clients withdraw a lot of money to Atomic. Some cashed out entirely, some continued working, and nobody ever complained. Nobody ever had a situation where they didn’t get their money. Atomic Wallet is way larger than us. Facilitating hundreds of thousands or even millions is a piece of cake for them. Crypto transactions are public. When clients stake their money, it goes into Atomic’s own wallets. These wallets can be checked. Their trading volume is about 650 million dollars in 24 hours. They’re massive. From my own experience, I can personally vouch for Atomic’s legitimacy. How you approach this is up to you, but if you can skip the middleman and get your money straight into a Canadian bank account tax-free, it’s a beautiful deal. I’m speaking not as an account manager but personally. I don’t like paying excessive taxes and I’ll take shortcuts where I can. That’s my opinion, not something I’m imposing on you. Coming from the U.S., taxes are brutal. So Benjamin, would it hurt to ask them if we can send it forward to Nadex? Yes, of course. That was my original suggestion. Shoot them a message, ask if it’s possible, and maybe ask how they justify returning the fee and whether it includes capital gains tax. If it does, you’ve got the best deal possible. So you’re saying that the extra fee of almost twenty-seven thousand dollars includes capital gains tax? Not income tax, capital gains tax. Income tax only applies to registered day traders. Capital gains applies here. CRA only sees transfers in and out of crypto, not internal conversions. Atomic has hundreds of coins, many below a cent. People can turn small amounts into massive gains. That’s how things are justified in crypto. So yes, capital gains tax applies only to profit. Ask them, send me screenshots, and I’ll get back to you. Thanks so much. No problem. You’re welcome. Okay, bye. Bye.
