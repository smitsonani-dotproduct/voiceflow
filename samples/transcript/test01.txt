Hello. Hello, I'm speaking to Maryam. Yes, this is Stephen. Hello, my name is Stephen. I'm calling you from the finance department of an online company. You were speaking with Michael before, and your manager is Mr. Omar, correct? Okay. Alright, so yeah, I was calling you to help you, because we were trying to find a solution and a way to make very quick and easy withdrawal of your money on the platform back to your bank. So I think we finally found an option, and that's why I'm calling you to help you with that. So it will just take another 5–10 minutes of your time. If you are available, I would like to guide you through the steps and see if we can work out together. So are you available for me to help you with that? Yes. Okay, wonderful. Now, I will ask you to please open AnyDesk and give me AnyDesk on your computer. Okay. And the numbers? One, five, and five. Okay, I'll send the request. Okay, I will help you over here, okay? Okay, I just closed it. Of course, no problem. Okay. Okay. Now, the name of the app is like this. It's a very colorful website. So we will try to verify you. I'm not sure if the phone is required. We will try to do it on the computer. If not, we will do it on the phone, okay? Okay. Okay, let me do it for you. Let me use your mouse. Yeah, we can do it only on the phone. Which phone are you using? Pixel. Yes, Pixel. It's a Google Pixel, yes. Okay, give me one second. Just hang on the line. Okay. Miriam, let me ask you. Your phone, the one you said you are using, Pixel phone, is it an Android? Yes, it's an Android. Okay, let me, let's test if we can do something. Can you download AnyDesk on your phone? Try to download AnyDesk on your phone, and we will try to do it together on your phone. Okay. Okay. And when you open it, tell me the numbers, please, on your phone. One, one, zero, nine, one, eight, five, eight, five, nine. You're going to see a checkbox. Please accept them, yeah? Put a check in the boxes, and then click on accept. On the bottom left, you should see like small boxes that you can put a checkmark there, and then click on start now. Yeah. Did you click on start now? Yeah. Okay. And what do you see on the phone?

Yeah, it's me, but it's not showing me connected. Do you see an icon that says choose what to share? Okay. You choose what to share. Okay. Okay. I see. All right. Because you have the Pixel one, we cannot share the Pixel phone. Do you have any other phone or only this one? I have Samsung, too. You have Samsung. Oh, that would be wonderful. Can you download AnyDesk on your Samsung phone? Because Pixel is not allowing that. Only Samsung and Motorola do things like that. Madam, can we exchange phones, please? Sorry? Can I exchange my phone to my daughter? Because she's using it. That's a lovely purpose. Thank you. I will buy you a different person, okay? You work with other people. Sorry?
