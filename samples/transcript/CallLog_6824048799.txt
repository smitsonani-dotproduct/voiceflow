 thank you for calling Valid Mortgage. My name is Jacob. Agent ID is 1320. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? Hi, Jacob. This is Adria Magnus. Hello. How are we doing today? Okay. I'm calling up a couple of things I'm a little confused about. I'm sure you can help me. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. Let me access the account real fast. No, no. They actually populated when you called in, so I do appreciate that. And it did show that you came in fully authenticated, so I'll be all good to go. Thank you, though. All right. And I'm now into the account. What kind of questions do we have for today? There are really two of them. One is there is a late charge of $51.46. Apparently, my... I've never paid anything late before. Apparently, my monthly amount changed, and I had this on auto pay, and so I just assumed that the correct amount was going to be taken out and when i was notified that it hadn't been i paid the difference but you you still charged me a late fee which i would like you to eliminate will do i can definitely do that right now you're the best and perfect I was able to if that right now. You're the best. And perfect. I was able to waive that late fee off the account. So there's no outstanding fee balance anymore. Great. Now my next question is, I got a updated escrow analysis and payment update. And, you know know I'm going to try to auto pay again and I don't want to get myself in trouble and I honestly can't tell what I am paying for December January and February gotcha yeah this one this escrow analysis I can tell it's a little confusing so I can definitely break this down for you okay so let me see escrow analysis performed perfect okay so right now your payment amount is reflecting as a one thousand six hundred eighty nine dollars and ninety cents the reason why it's reflecting that is because that will be the payment for January the reason why the January payment is less than the other ones is because we did determine there was a surplus of $38.63 which we do have to uh refund back to you um let me see that's been issued out yeah not yet let me take a look into this real quick so sorry yeah aren't you just going to take it off whatever my monthly payment is after that? I mean, it looks to me like – yeah. That is accurate. So yes, so the January's payment, since there's a surplus of the $3,863, we're actually just removing that from the January's payment. And then starting in February, the 17-28-53, that will be your new payment from February 2026 to February of 2027. Okay. Okay. I was confused because it said that your new monthly mortgage payment starting January 1st. And I saw two numbers and I wanted to make sure I had it correct. So, okay. all all right you answered my question yes are you going to be able to some sort of confirming email that you've eliminated that 51 fee let me see if i can type something up for you right now i mean i know i just got one from you saying i owed it to you so somewhere in there if you just send a confirmation, that would be great. Yeah, of course. Let me see. Yes, I can definitely type something up for icloud.com Is that correct? That is correct, yes. Perfect. So I have that sent out to you right now. You can expect it within about a minute after this call. Yeah, that's fine. I'm not in any rush. I just appreciate you doing this, and you've been a great help. Thank you. Of course. And before I let you go, were there any questions that I might have overlooked for today? I don't think so. Oh, I just got your email. Perfect. Yes. All right. And then before I do let you go, I do see that you've been building equity inside your your home just like to know if you want to explore the options to access the cash but things like home improvements no i do not no worries i'll let you go so you have a wonderful day there might be a brief survey at the ending of the call that's fine that's fine all right thank you so much of course bye bye did I stay on the line for it or yes it should populate after this call if you don't get a survey that would be okay I know sometimes system is low like 5050 with them so if you get one I really do appreciate it if you fill it out if not that'd be okay you enjoy your day okay thank you you too thank you
