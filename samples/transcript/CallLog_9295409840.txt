Hi, thank you for calling Valor Mortgage. My name is Charlotte, agent ID number 1152. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Charlotte, this is Roman from the insurance service department on a recorded line for quality training purposes. What's happening? How are you? Charlotte, I'm doing well. How about yourself? Man, one of your agents made me mad today. Oh, no, that wasn't me. I could tell you that. No, it wasn't you. It was one of the people on your side, though. Yeah, I'm not going to speak for everybody. I'll speak for myself. Yeah, nope. I like you. Good dude. What's happening? What's going on? I have an upset customer. So here you go. It's not one of us. It's the customer now. Mr. Francisco Hernandez, loan number 9295409840. He wants to discuss his escrow account. Oh, god. Did you advise him that I'm going to have to validate his identity when you transfer him? No, but I think it'll be fine. I mean, he's already upset. Roman, you're really trying to get me in trouble today. I took part of the heat. You could take the other part. Dude. OK, Charlotte. Let me bring him over. Get him transferred over. I'll get it. I got it. All right, thanks, Charlotte. Hold on. Mr. Hernandez? Sir? Yeah, go ahead. OK, I have Charlotte from our customer service department. She's going to be taking care of you regarding your escrow questions, OK? Just to remind you, we are on a recorded call. Charlotte, go ahead. Hi, this is Charlotte, agent ID number 1152 here at Valor Mortgage on a recorded line. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Francisco Hernandez. How are you doing today, Francisco? I just wanted to say thank you for calling the insurance service center, Mr. Francisco. Bye-bye, Charlotte. Sorry. Thank you. It's OK, Roman. Thank you. All right, sorry about that, Francisco. How are you doing today? OK, OK, I'm trying to figure it out. I'm trying to get insurance. I was going to do insurance with a company that shows on your system. But they were quoting me something different, something that I call DP1, which basically it takes a lot of the coverage, if you want to put it like that, from HO3. I don't know why they do that and why they didn't tell me anything about it. But anyway, so I called a couple of places around and I found one that is a lot more, but it covers me some. So anyway, I wanted to find out. He was not able to tell me how much is my escrow. When I look at my account, I couldn't see it because it shows that they already have withdrawn the money or something like that. And I didn't approve anything. And I'm trying to talk to these people. So they are supposed to be sending you the papers or the insurance or whatever it is that you guys need to put it in the system. And with the remaining of the escrow, I guess you guys divided that into monthly payments or something like that, right? Yes and no. Escrow is a little tricky, OK? Let me go ahead and verify the account with you and your identity. And then I'll be more than happy to go ahead and take a look at what we have on file and what's notated on the account to be able to better assist and answer your questions and concerns regarding the escrow. Is that OK? OK. Yeah, go ahead. OK, perfect. So could you verify for me the last four of your social? 6226. Thank you. And then the property zip code? 32703. Thank you for that. Let me get over here and see what's going on. All right. Um, OK. So I do see it was listed as loggerhead. And that was, um, the policy looks like it is set to either renew or expire tomorrow. But then I have one listed as people's trust that takes effect tomorrow. Yeah, that's the one I'm canceling right now. The people's trust? Yeah, that's the one I told them to stop because they are, that's a low, I don't know, when I was going through it, it just was not covering anything. OK. I don't know why they submitted it when I didn't tell them to. So I'm talking to another company. Her name is Megan. I don't remember the name of the company. It's Little Insurance or something like that, Little Star Insurance. OK. But they already should have sent you some stuff because we've been dealing with this since the 10th. And so I don't know what you guys have or what is the process of it. OK. Yeah, sure. Now, did she advise you if she sent in that document with request for payment for that policy? Did she send it to Valen at IHaveInsurance.com? I don't know. OK. So we need to find that out. OK. Now, as far as the other policy getting paid, not a big deal because once you've notified them that you're canceling that policy, they're going to have to issue you a refund. And then I always recommend once you get that refund, put it right back into the ESCR account. OK. Currently, the ESCR account balance is... Wait. Wait. Wait. Number one, I'm not going to request anything because I have not paid anything. Right? OK. But if you're canceling the policy that we just submitted payment to today for $1,887... Right. But you submitted a payment that I didn't... Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. You're submitting a payment that I didn't ask you to submit it. No. Because the insurance company... I didn't sign. That's our job. I didn't... No, no. The president can request whatever they want, and it is between you and them. It doesn't have nothing to do with me. One thing is for me to be looking at quotes, and the other thing is for me to approve anything. OK. I didn't approve. All I did... But did they notify you that they were increasing your premium? Who? Because they sent us the insurance company. They sent us the request to pay out the policy probably a month ago. They typically send it out about a month before it came in. Are you talking about Loggerhead? No. I'm talking about the People's Trust. That's who we just paid. The People's Trust is the one that, if I'm not mistaken, that's the company that is under your website, under your system. OK? And this was about a week ago. OK? Not even that. This was like four or five days ago. I looked into it. They called me. I looked at the number. He showed me something. He sent something to me. I started reviewing them to see exactly what it was. OK? I didn't approve anything. He has sent me a good face, as everybody has so far at this point. OK? But nobody has requested any payment from you guys. So the fact that you guys work together with them or whatever it is that you have, that doesn't have nothing to do with me. You know? I'm asking for quotes. You offer on your page the ability to click in there and ask for a quote, and that's what I did. I asked for a quote. I have not signed any documents. I haven't signed anything. That's why when I went into my account to look at how much escrow I have, to compare it with whatever they're quoting me on this company that I'm working with, I see that it says negative 232. So I called the number from Valoon, but it transferred me directly to this guy that I was talking to. I didn't know he was the insurance company. But I'm calling Valoon number. So anyway, so I say, why do you guys request for money that I have not approved? I didn't ask you for it. Oh, we were doing whatever it is that they say, but no problem because the money has not gone through yet or whatever. Do you want me to make a stop payment? And I said, well, I haven't even asked you to even do anything. All I asked was a quote. Anybody can ask for a quote, but I'm not approving anything. And you are absolutely correct in that. You can ask for a quote, but they wouldn't have sent a request for payment if there wasn't something agreed upon technically, and we wouldn't have sent payment out. They've been calling me for the last four days. Let's do this. I'm going to place you on a brief hold, and I'm going to do some digging for the account. So bear with me a few moments. Hi, Francisco, are you still there? One second. One second. Oh, my God. One second. Yeah, go ahead. Okay. So after speaking with an agent over at our insurance services team, I got a little bit better understanding of what's going on. So, yes, people's choice is considered a lender's choice type of insurance. Why they sent a request for payment with the policy, I don't know. Okay. But I was insured that this agent could tell that the prior agent did put a code on the account payment to stop that payment, and it's going to freeze that payment from going anywhere. Okay? And the reason for that is because you had indicated to him that you didn't want that policy paid out because you were still shopping around for insurance. Okay? So what I am highly suggesting to you is once you figure out what carrier you're going to go with, you're definitely going to have to have your agent or that company reach out to us so that we can get this updated because the current policy that your coverage is with, with Loggerhead, it expires tomorrow. Yeah, but she's actually on my other line, and she's listening to what you're saying, and she said she already submitted all the papers to you guys. Yeah, it can take a few days for that to process. But I can send them to you. If you can give me a website where I can upload the documents, I can do that right now. Or email it to her and she can send the documents to you. Okay, can you give her that information, please? I can. Again, because it's general information, email is going to be valon, V like Victor, A-L-O-N like Nancy at I have insurance.com. Or you can upload at I have insurance.com forward slash valon. I've already got the email ready to go. Okay. So you can send it right now, right? And you guys can take it. Okay. Even though I'm not going to disclose any information to her, Francisco, about the account, but I need to know the carrier name and if possible a policy number and a premium amount so I can reach back out to my insurance services team and have them update your account on their end so that they know when that comes in, they're going to go ahead and process that. Okay. Can you provide that, Megan, please? I sure can. The policy number is 9191-005377. Okay. So the phone did cut out a little bit. Okay. The phone did cut out a little bit. Could you provide me with the beginning of the policy number up until the 9-1? I've got everything after that. It just ends in Sam being like, boy. Okay. So Sam Brady 9-1-005377? Correct. And it's going to be 12-13-25 to 12-13-26. What's the carrier name? That's correct. It's a benchmark specialty insurance company. Benchmark specialty insurance. Benchmark is one word. Yep. I got it. Okay. All right. And then I'll go ahead and get this information. Oh, yeah, that would be good. What's the premium amount? Okay. $2,965.10. $2,965.10? That's correct. All right. Thank you for that. All right. No problem. Okay, Megan. Do you need, Megan, for anything else? I do not, no. Okay. Okay, Megan. Thank you so much. I'll call you if I need you, okay? Thank you. Bye-bye. All right. So you have everything you need at this point, right? Correct. I am going to place you on a brief hold, and I am going to reach back out to insurance services. So what's going to happen is we're going to have them cancel that payment going out to people's trust. Okay? Okay. So that those funds can be available. I wish I would have done it with you guys, because it's supposed to be easier for me. But I don't know. When I started going over the insurance, it looks like I lost a lot of stuff, you know? And then when I was talking to different people, they say, yeah, but are you renting the property? And I go, no, I live in it. So why are they giving you a DP-1 and not a HO-3? So I don't know nothing about insurance. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about. I do. I do. It's the way they had your property listed. They assumed that it was a rental property and not a primary residence. Why? I've been there now for – I don't know. Since 2015. I couldn't tell you that. I honestly couldn't. But let me place you on a brief hold. I'm going to reach out to insurance services. Let them know that that code 7 on that other payment, we need to adjust that to stop payment, cancel payment. And then I'm going to provide them with the information she gave me so that they can notate that when that comes in, that payment needs to go out, okay? So you've got to bear with me a few minutes longer, okay? All righty. All right. Thanks, Francisco. One moment. Francisco, are you still there? Yes, I'm here. Oh, okay. So, hey, Francisco, a little bit of a snag in our mission today. Unfortunately, the agent that I have on the line cannot take the information that Megan gave me. So, unfortunately, he is going to have to reach out to her with you on the line so that he can obtain the same information from her that she just provided me. But I'm going to go ahead and notate this on the account on my end and send it to our internal insurance for you. Okay. Okay. So does she have the information? Does she have the number? Or does he have the number? I don't have that for Megan, no. You'll have to give him Megan's contact number so he can call her. Okay. Okay. I do apologize. I'll go ahead and leave you with the insurance services agent. Okay. All righty. Thank you. What was your name again? My name is Sharla. Sharla. Okay, Sharla. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye-bye.
