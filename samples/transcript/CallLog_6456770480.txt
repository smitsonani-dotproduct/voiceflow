I do want to let you know that this call will be monitored or recorded for quality assurance purposes. Do you mind providing me with your first and last name, please? Yes, Hockham, last name Jerome. Thank you so much. Do you mind verifying the last four of your social? 9096. And your date of birth? 11-26-51. Perfect. Thank you so much. Give me one second. And then I was able to pull up the account, but before I'm able to access it, it does look like you've built equity in your home. Would you be interested in speaking with somebody about that today? No, not today. No problem. And then I do understand that you have questions on your escrow balance. How may I assist today? Yeah, so I just want to get this up to date so the payment is back to where it was. Basically what happened, there were two policies, so they paid out twice. Long story short, I got the refund check for one of the policies so there's only one active policy on file so I just need to apply that refund check back to the escrow accounts and see if there's anything else additional that's needed on top of that to bring the payment back to where it should be instead of going up next month. Got it. No problem. What is the amount that you received or that you're putting back into the account? Well, let me confirm the amount to be exact. It's for $4,895.38. sense. I did look at the, I guess, escrow statement online, and it's showing, if I'm not mistaken, it's showing a shortage of $5,244.64. That is correct. Okay. So, that's what needs to be reapplied back and then that you guys would reanalyze the escrow? Is that how it works? Yes. So, are you looking to make just the $4895.38 or are you looking to make the shortage amount? No. Well, I want to do the shortage that way it doesn't increase the payment. Okay. So, you're looking to do the $5244.64? Yes, and I was wondering, am I able to schedule that payment to be drafted next Thank you. Okay, so you're looking to do the $52, $44, $64? Yes, and I was wondering, am I able to schedule that payment to be drafted next week? You can, yeah. Once the payment is cleared, then that'll be adjusted. It does take about three to five business days for that to be adjusted. Is that okay with you? That's fine. Yeah, because I us enough time i just because i deposited the check i just want to make sure it's officially available before drafting um so if we could schedule it maybe for the 8th of december to get drafted okay and then i do want to let you know that um when you pay the shortage amount your payment does decrease by approximately $437.05, so your payment will approximately, let's see, one second, it'll go from $2,919.01 to approximately $2,481.96. Okay. Yeah, I think that's where it was. yeah um it was at 23 54 50 so it'll still increase slightly but it won't like go back to that specific amount i'm so sorry you're cutting out what was that you're you're like really like cutting out like choppy can you hear me okay? Hello? Can you hear me okay? Yeah, so it sounds like you're speaking you're just like breaking up really bad I can't make out what you're saying I'm sorry you do sound the same sorry Thank you.
