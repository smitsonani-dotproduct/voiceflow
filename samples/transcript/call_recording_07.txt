I'm calling about the HD 2771 hard drive I ordered. This is Linda Garcia and the order number is 654321. It was supposed to arrive 3 days ago and I haven't received any updates. The tracking information online is useless. I need this for my business and this delay is causing problems. Can you please look into this and tell me where my order is?
