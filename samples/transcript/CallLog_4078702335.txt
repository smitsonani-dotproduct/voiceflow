Internet. Yes. Hi, this is St. Arnold with Ballard Mortgage. Again, agent ID 1400 on a recorded line. Can you verify your property address zip code for me? 02864. Okay, thank you for that. I apologize. I had to call you right back, but I wanted to make sure I made you aware the requirement is going to be for two payments because you, we have to have a process in month. You will, in two days, you'll be seven months past due. So we can't process it. We won't be able to, they won't be able to process it. They're going to deny it out. So I don't want that to happen without you being aware that the requirement is going to be for two payments to be made in order for them to finalize or for them to process it. Are you able to... When do I have to make those payments? As soon as possible, because once January 1st hits, you're going to be due for seven payments, and it's already been submitted over to the underwriting team as of today. And if they start their review, it's going to get denied out because it's going to be past the required time frame. So that could be rather early in their process review. So that could be as early as next, what's today as early as next week pretty much because friday's the second so i would say yeah as early as next week it could get denied out yes that is not fair because no i i can't that's not fair because i've been speaking to your company for over a month, and they asked me all the questions. I said that I needed to put these payments at the end of the loan. They said okay. I was under the impression that this was being processed. When I've been speaking to someone, they've been calling me every other week, every week, and I ask for that, and they tell me that it's in process so nobody's told me that i needed to make these payments i i don't have two payments no i don't have a payment for next week so i don't i don't think you're being fair to me at all okay so, so we did reach out because the payment deferral was requested verbally. And like I mentioned previously, we had to get some valid information from you. Nobody's called me. Nobody's left me a message. No. We have called you. Okay, did you leave a message? I'm not sure if they left a message. They're not necessarily required to leave a message, but they did call you. I'll see. I did and every time I saw two missed calls I saw two missed calls and I did call back and I get the collections department and they verify the information they tell me that it's in process I did call twice so, I did speak to someone actually last week, and they said that it was in process. They never told me that they needed verification or additional information. No, I was never being told that. So I'm not sure whether to comment on that. I'm sorry that you weren't told that then, but, you know, as I was going through and submitting it over and going through the underwriting and just as I was finalizing everything after we got the call I realized that it's going to get denied out um so if you don't have the two payments then I think the best option would be for you to do um an application and possibly see if you can qualify for a modification which won't require I don't want to do a modification. You don't want to do a modification. No, I don't want to do a modification because I'm in the program for the first six months. That's because I had a hardship, but I am back now. But you're asking for two payments. That's $2,900 times two. So that's over $5,000. Nobody has that kind of money. I mean, nobody I know. I just came out of a hardship. I'm just trying to catch up on my bill. I completely understand that, Ms. Antoinette. I just know what the requirements are in spite of the parents that you were in. Well, this was supposed to be a long about a month ago so if this is submitted a month ago i would have i would have not been in this in this situation you're submitting this one day before before my my modification is up i mean i don't know how many cases you have but when you my case, I mean, you got to my case on the last day of the year. That's not fair to me. Are you able to make one payment, and I can try and get them to escalate it? I'm not able to make one payment, no, because I have 15 days to make the payment. So I was going to try and make the payment next week. Okay. Well, I will put that communication in the request to them, well i will i will put that in the communication in the request to them and we will see what the underwriting team says and um i will advise them that it should have been submitted previously and see if they're able to do anything i can't make any guarantees that that is going to suffice but i mean put yourself in my shoes it is not fair Can you please explain to them that I was just notified today that I have to make the payments? I mean, I don't think that that would be true. I will absolutely indicate that, but understand that we have been trying to call you as well. I do not have any messages, and every time I had a missed call, which was twice, I called back. And I did not speak to anybody okay I and it was just that people and actually they went over my account they asked me for my information and they told me that it's in process and if you can see the notes I'm sure that you're going to verify that's ever told me that they needed to verify information for me to be actually submitting an application. I was under the impression, because they've told me many times that the application is in process and it takes 30 days. Okay. Well, I will submit that over. I see that. I'm just letting you know the information that I have in front of me, we'll see what the outcome is okay yes ma'am all right thank you again for taking my call you're welcome okay
