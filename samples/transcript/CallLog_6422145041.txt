Hi, my name is Jean-Pierre, and I received a check for $373.33 from you guys from Valor Mortgage Inc. With no explanation, I don't know, because my mortgage was recently sold to you guys from Wholesale Mortgage, so I don't know what the $373 was for. Is this like a late fee?

And I'm just going to look at your escrow statement. It looks like it was sent to you just recently. This escrow statement shows that you have a surplus, meaning there was extra money in your escrow account. So anything over $50 we send to you, and that's what looks like it happened. We sent you the 37333 because that was how much is over in the account. Okay. That's the reason. Okay. It didn't attach. It didn't come with the account. If it had expanded on the attachment, then I wouldn't be calling. I just re-sent you the email. You should receive it now. I just re-sent the email. Check your spam. But it's the email that I sent you that does have the escrow statement in it that does give an explanation on that. Okay. Thank you. No problem at all. Is there anything else I'm able to help you with? No, that's all. All right. There's a brief survey for me at the end of this call. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day and happy holidays. Okay? Thanks. You too.
