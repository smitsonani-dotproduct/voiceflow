Hi, this is Maria Rodriguez. I'm having trouble with my LAP2110 laptop, order number 987654. The Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, and I can't get a stable internet connection. I've tried restarting it multiple times, and I've checked my router, but everything else is working fine. This is incredibly frustrating, I need this for work. Can you please help me troubleshoot this?
