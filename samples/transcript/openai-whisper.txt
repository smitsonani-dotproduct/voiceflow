Today, I will talk about OpenAI Whisper model. Basically, Whisper is a state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition and speech translation. Proposed in the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-scale Weak Supervisors by Alec Redford from OpenAI trained on greater than 5 million hours of labelled data. Whisper demonstrated strong ability to generalize to many From OpenAI, trained on greater than 5 million hours of labelled data, Whisper demonstrates strong ability to generalize to many datasets and domains in zero-shot settings. Whisper-LargeV3 has the same architecture as the previous Large and LargeV2 models, except for the following differences.
